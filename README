Screenshots of the program and Windows and Linux binaries compiled by Antti Vainio are available on his site at:

This program simply generates a scene using the random midpoint displacement algorithm.
In addition, the scene is lit and shadowed in a rather bad way which takes quite a lot of time.
After that, the program renders the scene using OpenGL.

NOTE:
The landscape.cpp file contains all the interesting stuff and all the defines you can easily play with.

You can move inside the scene using mouse and WASD-keys.


Compiling instructions:
The program can be compiled at least on Windows and Linux.
Linux users may use the provided Makefile to compile the program. You must have the dev package of SDL installed to compile.
If you don't use the Makefile (like on Windows) you should link at least glu32, opengl32, SDL and SDLmain (and mingw32 if using MinGW).


Running the program:
Once compiled, you must have your graphic card drivers installed and support for OpenGL 1.1.


You may use all the source codes for anything you want.
